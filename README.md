# food_decider
Dear Emmett and Jean, 
Program in C :) (And don't do the SML! thing...)
But admittedly, C was a very dumb and painful choice for this. 


A small library implemented in C to help decide what food to eat each day based using a linked list structure, created as an bet to prove that C is usable in application :)
